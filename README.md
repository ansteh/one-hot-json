# one-hot-json
on development

# Purpose
flattening and encoding JSON Objects

# Spark of Need
Many multivariate algorithms depend on array-like data. There is a need for modules to transform JSON Objects into such kind of data in a reasonable and easy to use manner. The main goal is to deliver a module with a generic encoding and decoding functionality for a collection of JSON Objects of the same Schema.

# Approach
Flattening JSON Objects and encoding string values via one-hot approach.
